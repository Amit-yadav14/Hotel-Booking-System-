A hotel booking system in C++, console-based, involves managing hotel rooms, customer reservations, and handling booking transactions. 
Here's a brief overview of what such a project might entail:

Room Class: Create a class to represent a hotel room with attributes such as room number, type (single, double, suite), availability status, price, etc. Include methods to set and get these attributes.

Customer Class: Implement a class to represent a customer with attributes like name, contact information, booked rooms, etc. Include methods to add and remove booked rooms.

Booking System Class: This class would manage the overall booking system. It would contain methods for booking a room, canceling a booking, checking room availability, displaying available rooms, displaying booked rooms, etc.

Main Class: This would be the entry point of the program. It would handle user input and interact with the Booking System class to perform various operations like booking a room, canceling a booking, etc.

Data Persistence: Implement functionality to save and load data (like room and customer information) to and from files. This ensures that data is not lost when the program exits.

Validation: Add validation checks to ensure that users cannot book a room that is already booked or cancel a booking that doesn't exist.
